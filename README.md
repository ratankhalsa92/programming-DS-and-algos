# Algorithms & Data Structures

This project is a collection of the Algorithms I program and the Data Structures I use to achieve those.
I have primarily used Java for my works but of late, I am using Python more and more for it's readibility and ease of using on the go.

I plan to push the code samples I have while brushing up on the generic Data Structures one practices for their Coding Interviews.
Every Algorithmic problem that I encounter and solve would be pushed here.
